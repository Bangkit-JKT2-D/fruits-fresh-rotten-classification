# Fresh-Rotten-Fruits-Predictor
--this is a final project assignment--
We create a Tensorflow model to predict the fresh and rotten fruits. By doing so, we hope we can easily separate fresh and rotten fruits from fruit images.

## Datasets
Training Data and Testing Data that were used are sourced from kaggle :https://www.kaggle.com/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification

## Network
For this model, we use Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Prequisites
You don't need to install anything since its written in Google Colab which is a cloud service

## Built With
* [Tensorflow Keras](https://www.tensrflow.org) - The AI framework used
