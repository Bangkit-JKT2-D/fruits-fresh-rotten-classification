# Fake-News-Predictor
--this is a part of an assignment--
We create a Tensorflow model to predict the authenticity of a news. By doing so, we hope we can easily separate fake news from real news.

## Datasets
Training Data and Testing Data that were used are sourced from kaggle :https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

## Network
For this Natural Languange Processing, we use Recurrent Neural Network because its designed to work with sequence prediction problems. Since RNN were traditionally difficult to train, we use the most successfull RNN which is The Long Short-Term Memory, or LSTM.
RNN in general and LSTMs in particular have received the most success when working with sequences of words and paragraphs.

## Prequisites
You don't need to install anything since its written in Google Colab which is a cloud service
